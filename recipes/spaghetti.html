    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        One-pot spaghetti puts Italian sausage, pasta sauce, and noodles together for a dish you can have on the table in less than 45 minutes. 
        <br>It doesn't get much easier than this by cooking everything in one pot. 
        <br>Switch it up by using ground beef, chicken, or turkey along with any other of your favorite ingredients, such as sliced mushrooms.
        <br>Simply <em>delightful!</em>
